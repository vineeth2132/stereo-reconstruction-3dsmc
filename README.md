# Stereo Reconstruction

A C++ stereo reconstruction pipeline implemented with OpenCV and Eigen.

The current pipeline performs:

1. Stereo image loading
2. Camera intrinsics loading
3. SIFT keypoint detection
4. Sparse feature matching with ratio filtering
5. Fundamental matrix estimation with RANSAC
6. Essential matrix computation
7. Relative camera pose recovery
8. Stereo rectification
9. Dense disparity-map generation with StereoBM or StereoSGBM

## Requirements

* CMake 3.20 or newer
* A C++20-compatible compiler
* [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
* OpenCV
* Eigen3

The required libraries are listed in `vcpkg.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    "opencv4",
    "eigen3"
  ]
}
```

## Project Structure

```text
stereo-reconstruction/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── vcpkg.json
├── include/
├── src/
├── data/
├── out/
└── build/
```

The `build/` directory contains generated build files and should not be committed.

## Dataset

The current implementation has been tested with the **ETH3D `delivery_area_undistorted` dataset**.

A small set of sample images from this dataset is included under the `data/` directory so that the pipeline can be run without downloading the full dataset.

The currently used paths are defined in `src/main.cpp`. Update them if your local dataset structure is different.

Example:

```cpp
DataLoader dataLoader(
    "../data/delivery_area/images/dslr_images_undistorted/");
```

The camera intrinsics file should follow the COLMAP `cameras.txt` format.

Example:

```text
0 PINHOLE 6208 4135 3408.59 3408.87 3117.24 2064.07
```


## Build Instructions

Replace `<VCPKG_ROOT>` with the path to your local vcpkg installation.

### Windows

Open PowerShell in the project root directory:

```powershell
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. `
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="<VCPKG_ROOT>\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake"

cmake --build . --config Release
```

Run:

```powershell
.\Release\stereo_reconstruction.exe
```

For a debug build:

```powershell
cmake --build . --config Debug
.\Debug\stereo_reconstruction.exe
```

The configure step also generates a Visual Studio solution inside `build/`. It can be opened directly:

```text
build/stereo_reconstruction.sln
```

### Linux

Open a terminal in the project root directory:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build

cmake .. \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="<VCPKG_ROOT>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"

cmake --build . --parallel
```

Run:

```bash
./stereo_reconstruction
```

## Reconfigure After Adding Source Files

When a new `.cpp` or `.h` file is added, update `CMakeLists.txt`.

Then regenerate the build files:

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
```

## Clean Build

If the build configuration becomes inconsistent, delete the generated build directory and configure again.

### Windows

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="<VCPKG_ROOT>\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake"
```

### Linux

```bash
rm -rf build
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="<VCPKG_ROOT>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
```

## Current Notes

* StereoBM and StereoSGBM are both available for disparity-map generation.
* StereoSGBM generally provides denser disparity maps, but its parameters still need tuning.
* The recovered translation vector currently provides direction only. Metric depth reconstruction will require a known camera baseline.
